## Contributing to Monoweave

We offer a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) which takes care of most environment setup for you.
If you choose not to use the devcontainer, you will need [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) installed
and enabled.

#### If not using a devcontainer...

There is a bootstrap script you can source that will validate your environment for local development. It is recommended
to have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, however it is not required. Running the bootstrap script _will_
enable corepack for you. If you do not want this behaviour, run `. script/bootstrap --no-corepack`.

You can run `. script/bootstrap` whenever dependencies change, it will run `yarn` for you.

#### Technologies

This project uses:

- Language: [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Package Manager: [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Git Hooks: [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) and [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)

### Tests

#### Unit & Integration Tests

```sh
yarn test:watch
```

#### End-to-end Testing (E2Es)

```sh
yarn test:e2e
```

You can run `yarn :e2e test:registry:logs` to see a live stream of the registry logs.

### Build

You can execute `yarn build` to generate the build assets that ultimately gets uploaded to the NPM registry. It will also leave the intermediate `lib` artifacts, which contain the transpiled code.

### Running the local version of monoweave against a repository

```bash
yarn run-local --cwd <PATH_TO_OTHER_MONOREPO>
```

### Tips

#### Configuring Your IDE

##### VSCode

You'll need to download the [ZipFS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcanis.vscode-zipfs) extension to be able to use functionality such as "Go To Definition" with the zipped npm packages.

In a Typescript file, <kbd>Cmd + Shift + P</kbd> will open the command menu. Select "TypeScript: Select Typescript Version..." and use the version from the workspace.

#### Debugging Yarn API Packages

You can unpack all yarn zips via:

```bash
yarn unplug @yarnpkg/*
```

This will let you inspect yarn source code to debug stack traces.
